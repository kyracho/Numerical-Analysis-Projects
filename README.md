## Overview

Numerical analysis focuses on developing algorithms to approximate solutions for problems in continuous mathematics. These Jupyter Notebooks explore a range of topics, including:
- Solving linear and nonlinear equations
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Eigenvalue problems
- Approximation methods
- Differential equations and more

Each notebook provides code implementation, mathematical derivations, and visualizations to help users understand the underlying numerical methods.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository (or download the notebooks)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyracho/numerical-analysis-projects.git
   cd numerical-analysis-projects
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy pandas plotly scipy sympy ipywidgets
   ```

## Running the Notebooks

To run the Jupyter Notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the desired `.ipynb` file** from the list in the Jupyter interface.

3. **Interact with the code and visualizations**. Many notebooks contain interactive widgets and plots, so be sure to run each cell and explore the outputs.
